# Tips to create stable diffusion Prompts 
## 1. Set the scene
***Start out with a basic prompt describing your desired image. Address multiple keyword categories by describing the subject, setting, and color palette. Generate several images with your initial prompt and review the results.**

## 2. Add more keywords
***If the initial outputs don’t align with your expectations, use iterative prompting to build on your initial instructions. Provide new keywords and additional details to modify the image. For example, if the image is too abstract, try inserting "hyper realism" in the prompt.**

## 3. Use a negative prompt
***Negative prompts are instructions that tell the model what not to include in the generated image. A negative prompt can be a powerful tool for refining imagery by eliminating unwanted elements.**

***For example, say you input the following prompt: “A young woman with brown hair and blue eyes wearing a denim jacket stands in front of a vintage movie theater in a small town.” If Stable Diffusion produces an image with garbled text on the marquee, you could resubmit your instructions, this time with the negative prompt “no text in the image,” to yield a more polished final product.**

## 4. Check for common mistakes
 ***Look out for common mistakes in your generated images such as unorganized keywords and conflicting instructions. Stable Diffusion weights keywords based on their placement within the prompt. If elements of your prompt are missing or lacking prominence, try revising the prompt by placing the most important keywords near the front. You’ll find that adjusting the word order of a prompt can dramatically change the output.**

***Conflicting instructions can lead to low-quality images. For example, if your prompt includes both “standing in a crowd” and “dancing,” the AI might try to depict both of these actions, leading to an image with bad anatomy, like extra limbs or malformed hands. Read over your instructions and make sure they don’t include contradictions or redundancies.**
