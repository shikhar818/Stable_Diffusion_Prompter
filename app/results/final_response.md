Okay, let’s analyze these prompts and create the most effective one for generating a stunning image of Spider-Man sitting on a skyscraper during rain, with folded legs.

**Analysis:**

*   **Prompt 1:** This is a good starting point, but "comic book style" might detract from the realism we're aiming for.
*   **Prompt 2:** Strong detail – “wet suit”, "volumetric lighting”, and emphasis on photorealism. The “city skyline in the background” is also well-defined.
*   **Prompt 3:** The "cyberpunk aesthetic" could be a strong element, but “comic book style” should be removed. 
*   **Prompt 4:** Good overall, but the "serious expression" might not align with the typical Spider-Man vibe. The CFG Scale of 9 is high, which could lead to artifacts if not carefully managed.

**Refined Prompt & Negative Prompt:**

Here’s the consolidated prompt and negative prompt, incorporating the best elements and streamlining for optimal results:

**Prompt:** "Spider-Man sitting on the peak of a towering skyscraper during a heavy rainstorm, legs folded, detailed wet suit, city skyline in the background, photorealistic, 4k, volumetric lighting, rain droplets, reflections on the pavement, cinematic composition"

**Negative Prompt:** "blur, low quality, text, watermark, signature, deformed limbs, extra fingers, bad anatomy, cartoon, anime, sketch, painting, drawing, illustration, abstract, multiple limbs, tiling, out of frame"

**Justification for Changes:**

*   Removed “comic book style” from the prompt.
*   Specified “detailed wet suit” for greater realism.
*   Included “volumetric lighting” for dramatic lighting effects.
*   Expanded the negative prompt to explicitly exclude stylistic elements like “painting, drawing, illustration, abstract.”

**Stable Diffusion Parameters:**

| Parameter             | Value     |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| **Prompt**             | “Spider-Man sitting on the peak of a towering skyscraper during a heavy rainstorm, legs folded, detailed wet suit, city skyline in the background, photorealistic, 4k, volumetric lighting, rain droplets, reflections on the pavement, cinematic composition” |
| **Negative Prompt**    | "blur, low quality, text, watermark, signature, deformed limbs, extra fingers, bad anatomy, cartoon, anime, sketch, painting, drawing, illustration, abstract, multiple limbs, tiling, out of frame" |
| **Sampling Method**    | DPM++ 2M Karras |
| **Sampling Steps**     | 40          |
| **CFG Scale**          | 8           |
| **Image Dimensions**   | 1024x768   |


**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **DPM++ 2M Karras:** This sampler is known for producing high-quality, detailed images.
*   **40 Sampling Steps:** A higher number of steps generally leads to more refined details.
*   **CFG Scale of 8:** A balance between adherence to the prompt and creative freedom.
*   **1024x768:** This resolution provides a good balance between detail and generation speed.

This refined prompt and configuration should consistently deliver a fantastic image of Spider-Man in this dramatic scenario.  Let me know if you'd like to explore variations!
