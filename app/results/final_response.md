Okay, let’s analyze the provided prompts and generate a refined, consolidated prompt set for Stable Diffusion, prioritizing quality and detail.

**Analysis of Existing Prompts:**

All the prompts are generally good, but there's some redundancy and variation in the parameters that can be streamlined. The inclusion of "8k" is good for detail but can sometimes lead to overly complex images.  The negative prompts are mostly relevant, but could benefit from a slight adjustment.

**Refined Prompt Set**

Here’s a table summarizing the best elements and creating a single, optimized prompt with adjusted negative prompts:

| Prompt                                                                                                   | Negative Prompt                                                                                                                                   | Sampling Method       | Sampling Steps | CFG Scale | Image Dimensions (Height x Width) |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------- |
| "Spider-Man sitting powerfully on the highest skyscraper during a torrential rainstorm, legs folded in a dynamic superhero stance, wet suit, reflections in puddles, cinematic lighting, ultra-detailed, 8k" | “blur, watermark, text, cartoon, anime, deformed, bad anatomy, extra limbs, low quality, jpeg artifacts” | DPM++ 2M Karras       | 30            | 7         | 768x1024                          |


**Justification for Changes & Key Considerations:**

*   **Combined Prompt:** A more descriptive and evocative prompt is beneficial. Using phrases like "torrential rainstorm” and "dynamic superhero stance" helps guide the AI.
*   **Streamlined Negative Prompt:** Consolidating and slightly adjusting the negative prompt minimizes redundancy while still addressing common issues.  Adding “low quality, jpeg artifacts” directly combats often-generated issues.
*   **Sampling Method:** DPM++ 2M Karras is known for producing high-quality, detailed images and is a good general-purpose choice.
*   **Sampling Steps:** 30 is a good balance between detail and processing time.
*   **CFG Scale:** 7 – A balanced value that encourages creativity without sacrificing image coherence.
*   **Image Dimensions:** 768x1024 – This provides a good balance between aspect ratio and resolution for detailed output.

**Additional Tips for User:**

*   **Experiment with Seeds:**  Stable Diffusion relies heavily on the seed.  Changing the seed even slightly can drastically alter the outcome.
*   **Iterate:**  Don’t expect perfection on the first try.  Use the initial results as a starting point and refine the prompt and parameters based on what you see.
*   **Consider Img2Img:** If you have an initial image you like, try using Stable Diffusion’s “Img2Img” feature to guide the generation process further.

I hope this consolidated prompt and analysis are helpful for generating stunning Spider-Man images!
